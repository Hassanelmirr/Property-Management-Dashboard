# Property-Management-Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project presents an interactive dashboard in Power BI that allows for the analysis and management of a real estate portfolio.
The goal is to help decision-makers track the condition of properties, their location, characteristics, and renovation status in order to prioritize management actions.

## Objectives

1-Provide an overview of the real estate portfolio (location, number of bedrooms, floors, status).

2- Monitor key indicators:
  -Total number of properties
  -Breakdown by condition (Good, Very Good, Renovation)
  -Waterfront status (with or without ocean view)
  -Breakdown of properties by condition and location

3- Help identify properties requiring renovations or special attention.

## Features
  
  -Interactive filters (by property, city, year).
  
  -Dynamic visuals (bar charts, line charts, cards, KPIs).
  
  -Financial overview: rental income, expenses, profitability.
  
  -Occupancy analysis: vacancies, rent performance, efficiency ratios.

## Tools & Technologies

-Power BI – Interactive Dashboard Creation

-DAX & Power Query – Data Measurements and Transformations
